# RiverProblem
Three missionaries and three cannibals seek to cross a river. A boat is available which will hold two people, and which can be navigated by any combination of missionaries and cannibals involving one or two people. If the missionaries on either bank of the river, or 'en route' in the river, are outnumbered at any time by cannibals, the cannibals will indulge in their anthropophatic tendencies and do away with the missionaries. Find the simplest schedule of crossings that will permit all the missionaries and cannibals to cross the river safely.
